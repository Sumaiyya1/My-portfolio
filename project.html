    <blockquote>
        Pneumonia is an infection of one or both lungs caused by bacteria, virus or fungi. There are
more than 30 causes of pneumonia. Pneumonia may range in seriousness from mild to severe.
It is more serious when it affects older adults, infants, although it can occur at any age
pneumonia is more common in elderly people. There is type of pneumonia by location. If the
healthy person come in contact with infected particles or person than pneumonia gets
transmitted. There are symptoms of pneumonia main symptoms are coughing, fever with chills,
difficulty in breathing, chest pain. Pneumonia can be treated from antibiotics, antifungals if
complication occurs, we need to take some test such as urine test, blood test and chest x-ray.
Here doctor will check is patient have swelling or not, we detect that by depth-wise convolution
neural network algorithm in deep learning which help us to identify and diagnosed from
pneumonia. Depth-wise CNN is used to analyze visual image by processing data. CNN is
classified into three layers that is input layer, hidden layer and output layer.
